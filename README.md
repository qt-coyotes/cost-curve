# cost curve
- Try to use cost curve since we could not make sure what is the misclassification cost. The mange and non-mange ratio in the dataset does not necessarily represent the mange and non-mange ratio in the real world.
- cost_curve could select the optimal threshold which minimize the expected cost.
